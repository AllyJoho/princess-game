Topic / Prompt:
Falling in Love

Title: Worth the Climb (subject to change)

Story:
A Princess has been locked in a tower by a Dragon, and the King has offered her hand in marriage to anyone who can return her safely. The Dragon has discussed this with the princess and together, they agreed that if the suitor can make her fall in love with him, the Dragon won't eat the princess. The tone is supposed to be funny, here is some dialogue I wrote for that:

```
"<b>Dragon NPC</b><br/>'Why hello, brave Knight! Have you come to rescue the princess?<br/>I hear the King is offering her hand to anyone who can save her!<br/>Ha! Any fool can save the princess!<br/>Now, I've talked to the princess and we've devised... a plan.<br/>Yes. If you don't win her heart by the time you get up there, I'll eat you!<br/>I'll tell her you're on you're way!'"
```
Anyways, this dialogue is meant to be conveyed in a cutscene, and the text will appear in a block at the top of the screen with green text so they know it's the dragon speaking. The Knight (player character) will have grey text and the princess will have pink text. 

Gameplay is a platformer that involves jumping up to the top of the tower and collecting items as gifts for the princess. Depending on how successful the Knight is, the princess can respond in one of three ways: (1) she will fall in love with the Knight and they will run away together - win; (2) she will push the knight off, saying he's not good enough, and he will have to try again with new level generation - fail; and (3) she will run into her tower and the dragon will eat the knight - game over.

Gameplay:
There are 5 types of items, each with 3 variants, that the Knight can collect. These are the different kinds of items the Knight collects (subject to change):
1. Flowers: Daisy, Rose, Tulip
2. Weapon: Dagger, Poison, Bow
3. Book: Romance, Fantasy, History
4. Chocolate: Dark, Milk, Caramel 
5. Gems: Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald

The icon will be generic (like a book icon) and when the knight collects the item, a short menu will pop up and the Knight can choose between different kinds of books the princess would like. For each item, the princess will have one she likes, one she's indifferent to, and one she dislikes (randomly generated). Depending on her preferences, each item would contribute differently to the score. 

The idea is that every time the knight runs up, the Dragon give him a hint on what the princess likes. If he collects everything with the right preferences, the win condition is triggered and the princess falls in love. If he even gets some of her preferences, she pushes him off so he doesn't get eaten by the dragon, triggering a cutscene and allowing the level and item generation to reset. The dragon says something like "she must like you or I would've eaten you" and gives the Knight another hint. The idea is that the Knight learns what she likes over time and they fall in love over time, it's not really meant to be won on the first attempt. And if the Knight brings her nothing, or the score is negative, the Dragon eats him and the game is over. 

Even though the Princesses preferences are randomly generated, they are consistent with multiple attempts in the same game. It resets when the game is over or completely reset.
